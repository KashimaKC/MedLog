# MedLog

This is a personal project created by me for me. I struggle with IBS so I wanted to make a simple way to log every time I am in pain.
I hope that this will prove useful in creating a simple way to log medical issues and notice patterns in the data.
It utilizes React Native to create a simple and easy to adopt interface.

Stay safe, 
Joshua
